[![PyPI version](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/distro.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/amps/)
[![Supported Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/distro.svg)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/distro.svg)
[![Is Wheel](https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/distro.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.org/project/amps/)

`amps` scans all packages installed via pacman on your system and provides you a simple report of those with open CVE's reported [here.](https://security.archlinux.org/)

Amps currently only supports Arch Linux based systems, but apt, yum, dnf capabilities are planned to work for more devices.
